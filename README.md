# M5Stack Library

Arduino Library for M5Stack Electronic Modules

### How to use:

1. Download the source from the git https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack

2. copy the M5Stack folder to your arduino default library. Your Arduino library folder should now look like this  
   (on Windows): [arduino installation directory]
   Arduino\libraries\ 
   (on MACOS): [arduino Package Contents]
   ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/

3. Open the Arduino Application. (If it's already open, you will need to restart it to see changes.)

4. Click "File-> Examples". Here are some test programs in "M5Stack->"

5. Depending on the type of board you're using, you need to modify the header file to match.
   For example, if you're using a M5Stack. 
   You just `#include <M5Stack.h>`
